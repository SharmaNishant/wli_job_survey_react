                    As a lawyer, there are multiple career paths to take. Every company has legal
                    departments including heavy civil construction companies, engineering consulting companies, regulating
                    compliance companies, and specialized equipment companies (examples companies below). Contracts are a
                    large part of these companies and ensuring all liabilities are covered and accounted for is vital for
                    the company&rsquo;s financial health. Another path to take is to become a part of water advocacy and
                    fight for progress in the water industry. Going this path can mean many hours without the highest pay
                    but the social impact is rewarding.

                                            Reaching out to smaller companies first to gain exposure to the water industry is a great way to get to

                        advocate and having knowledge and connections with people in the water industry can help make decisions
                        that are best for the public.
